This webpage offers a data entry form's fundamental structure, including a straightforward design and necessary components. It has a data entry form, a submit button, a success message, and a responsive design. In addition, the website has a footer area with links to social networking platforms, privacy policies, about us, and licensing agreement pages as well as copyright information.The website tracks modifications to the data entries using Git. It commits changes to the repository and initialises or starts a Git repository. The data entries are kept in the repository, and modifications are monitored.A Python script on the website processes data entries and saves them to a JSON file. Based on the operands and operator, the script computes the calculation's outcome. Additionally, it commits the modifications to the Git repository and stores the newly entered data in the JSON file.The website is guarded against frequent online attacks by a number of security measures. Input validation, error management, and secure coding techniques are some of these aspects. In order to identify and stop any security risks, the website also has a security system that tracks and watches over all user behaviour.Create a new folder for your project and add the given HTML file to it in order to use this website. In the same folder, create a new file named script.js and add your customised JavaScript code to it. Make sure the links in the footer area lead to the correct sites by updating them. Tailor the functionality, layout, and design to your project's specifications as needed. To process data entries and store them to a JSON file, write a new Python script. The Python script may be deployed to a server to collect form input and do computations.The webpage offers an example of how to utilise the data entry form and Python script. The sample use shows how to handle an entry in the data, save it as a JSON file, and commit the modifications to the Git repository.To commit changes to the Git repository, use the commit message that is included on the website. The commit message contains the timestamp of the data entry along with the user's name and email address.To save the data entries to the JSON file, utilise the data entry format that is given on the website. The name, email address, message, operator, number1, number2, outcome, and timestamp of the data entry are all included in the format.The data entries are kept in a JSON file that is part of the website. The JSON file, data_entries.json, is stored in the data_version_control_repo folder.A Git repository on the website is used to monitor updates made to the data entries. The init_repo function is used to open or initialise the Git repository, while the commit_changes function is used to commit changes.Initiate repositories, commit modifications, and save data entries are some of the methods that the website utilises to process data entries and save them in a JSON file. These jobs are necessary to handle data input, save changes to the repository, and update the Git repository. For this, the process_data_entry function is employed.Use Python 3.x to install a website by doing the following steps: use Git to clone the repository, pip to install dependencies, create a new project folder, add HTML and JavaScript files, change footer links, and alter the functionality, layout, and design, To process data entries and store them to a JSON file, write a Python script. Then, deploy the script to a server for form data processing and computations.
